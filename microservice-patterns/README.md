Quick Pros and Cons of MSA
=================
- Pros
    - Smaler code base
        - Maintenance
        - New team members omboarding
    - Lose coupling
    - Easier to make them clusterable
        - Stateless
        - Runtime state ?

- Cons
    - Data consistency (DB per service)
    - Complex deployment (requires Orchestration)


---

Tipical comminucation channels
==================
- Request/Response
    - Simple
    - Node failuer ?
        - Istio
    - What about log running ?
- Request/Callback
    - How long to wait ?
    - How to monitor timeout ?
- MQ
    - How long to wait ?
    - How to monitor timeout ?

---

State
==================
- Data state
    - State of completed operations
    - Usually DB
- Runtime state
    - State of potentially long running operations
    - Shared Memory

---

Atomic operaton
==================
- 2PC not an option
- SAGA = Sequence of local transations
- 

---

The design
==================
- Event driven
    - Peer to peer event chain!
        - Example: checkout -> inventory -> payment -> shipping
        - No overview
        - Small change might require multiple service updates
- Using commands
    - Example: checkout -> Order service -> inventory -> Order service -> payment -> Order service -> shipping
    - Don't make CRUD services
    - Centralized Orchestration
